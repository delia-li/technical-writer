# Process
User-centric design approach

1. Identifying goals and solutions
2. Collecting user testimonies
3. Building the information architecture and site flow
4. Designing wireframes for core features
5. Designing wireframes for additional features
6. Building prototype
7. Iterating on feedback

# Problem Statement and proposed solutions
Transit riders face many challenges while using public transit and the apps that are currently available. These pain points include problems in existing apps and issues with transit in general, such as delays and reduced service.

* Existing apps have a number of issues: persistent lag and crashes in Transit app, out of date rider information in Google Maps, and poor visual accessibility and feature maintenance in OneBusAway.

* Official transit agency communications like Sound Transit and BART are too delayed to be useful. It is not helpful for riders to receive a text that trains will be cancelled after they are already waiting on the platform.

* Riders with disabilities arrive at stations where elevators or wheelchair-accessible entrances are out of service. This also impacts riders without disabilities who are carrying luggage or bikes.

_For northbound passengers, this means riding the train for at least an additional ten minutes to the next closest stop, getting off, and then taking a bus or a rideshare service. A text message like this one would also not be sufficient for southbound riders trying to plan ahead, because of how long it takes to reach Tukwila station from Rainier Beach station._

* Travelers visiting Seattle arrive at stations where the ticket machines are broken. Many tourists do not know where they can buy tickets or transit cards.

* Riders don't only want to see conditions on vehicles. They also want to see real-time updates on conditions at stations, before they arrive.

# User Research
Conducting user research involves two types of analysis: quantitative and qualitative research. 

## Qualitative research

For quantitative research, 15 transit riders from Seattle provided responses on their experiences with existing transit apps.

1. Which transit app do you primarily use?

2. Which problems have you encountered in existing apps?

## Quantitative research

For quantitative research, 3 transit riders from Seattle gave more detailed responses to questions about their experiences using transit apps.
