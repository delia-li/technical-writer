# Project Overview

Welcome to Rate My Transit, a mobile app that provides real time updates on travel conditions from the local transit community. The goal of Rate My Transit is to help transit users share information with each other and to make public transit more accessible and enjoyable for all riders.

# Process
User-centric design approach

1. Identifying goals and solutions
2. Collecting user testimonies
3. Building the information architecture and site flow
4. Designing wireframes for core features
5. Designing wireframes for additional features
6. Building prototype
7. Iterating on feedback

# Problem Statement and proposed solutions
Accessibility problems in existing apps

Official transit agency communications are too delayed to be useful (source reddit post)

Riders with disabilities arrive at stations where elevators or wheelchair-accessible entrances are out of service

Travelers from out of town arrive at stations where the ticket machines are broken

Riders want to know which trains and buses are too crowded so they can decide whether to get on the next one or plan an alternate route

Riders want to see real-time updates on conditions at stations, before they arrive

Riders want to check if stations are working without physically going to look at it themselves
